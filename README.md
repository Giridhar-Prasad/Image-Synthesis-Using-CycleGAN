# Image-Synthesis-and-Data-Extension-Using-CycleGAN
Addressing the persistent challenge of limited datasets in Machine Learning and 
Deep Learning, particularly in domains like Image Processing and Computer Vision, 
proves crucial. This issue is notably pronounced in projects focused on diseased 
plant detection, where acquiring and processing data poses significant hurdles.To 
overcome the scarcity of datasets, our project employs the transformative power of 
CycleGAN, a cutting-edge image style transfer technique. While traditionally used 
for tasks like translating images from zebras to horses and vice versa, we adapt 
CycleGAN to generate healthy plant images from diseased ones and vice versa, 
utilizing the Cassava Leaf Disease Dataset.This innovative approach not only 
addresses the data scarcity issue but also contributes to synthesizing diverse and 
extensive datasets. By seamlessly translating between healthy and diseased states, 
our model holds promise in enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities 
of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for real-world applications in plant 
disease detection.
